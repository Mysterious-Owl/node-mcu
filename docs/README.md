## Note
For basics check the [basic folder](https://github.com/Mysterious-Owl/node-mcu/tree/master/Basic) and understand the code, then move to [advanced](https://github.com/Mysterious-Owl/node-mcu/tree/master/Advanced), otherwise it will be difficult to understand it.<br>
The webpage is for demonstration only, there is no need to upload that anyhow, the webpage is already included in c code in string format.

Relay can be used instead of LEDs to control AC appliances.<br>
Bigger websites can be uploaded by SPI Flash File system.<br><br>
